# Sales_Dashboard
Power BI Dashboard
I created a interactive dashboard in powerBI to analyze online sales data. I created connections, join tables and perform some calculations
to manipulate data for visualizations.
 
I used different types of customized visualization like bar chart, pie chart, donut chat,
clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart,slicers,etc.
